# IPG Mediabrands Technical Back-End Test Deliverables

## Rationale
The reason why I chose **C++** for this task was because I'm the most comfortable and familiar with this language, however I believe that other languages would've been more suitable for this task like **Python** or **Java**.

## Assumptions Made in Order to Solve Problem
After thoroughly reading the document, I planned out on how I would layout the program. So my plan was as follows:
1. Welcome the user
2. Ask the user to input information
3. Output results
4. Ask the user if they want to enter another input, if yes, loop the program, if no, end the program.
5. End Program

The coding for the rest of the program was quite simple as I was already provided the calculations for the results.

## Instructions
### To Use Application
1. **Download** the `Back-End Technical Test.exe` file located in `IPGMediaBrandTechTest/Debug`.
2. **Open** the file using a Windows PC.
3. The application will prompt the user to enter data.
